It's really good. But it's also really exciting because there are three things in this phone that are going to be trends in smartphones for all of 2025. So even if this phone isn't for you, there's gonna be a lot more phones like it that are really good, which is sick. So those three things are the incredible battery, the chip, and the record-breaking display. So let's just get right into this battery. It's an easy place to start. This is the OnePlus 13, and it has a 6,000 milliamp-hour battery. This perfectly reasonably sized, kind of slim phone without being super thick has a battery literally double the capacity of the Galaxy S8. It's kind of nuts, actually. So if you've been keeping track of phone battery sizes for the past few years, you might be wondering what is happening? Like, how is this jump all of a sudden happening with a bunch of phones? Like the Galaxy S24 Ultra from last year, this, you know, full-size mega flagship, has an enormous 5,000 milliamp-hour battery, but yet suddenly there's a bunch of new phones in the past few weeks that are not thicker that have a 5,500, 6,000, even 7,000 milliamp-hour battery. Like, what is happening? And the answer is silicon carbon. These new batteries, without getting too technical, they are still lithium-ion batteries, but with a new silicon carbon anode or a mixture of silicon and graphite. But the results have really spoken for themselves. They've been bangers. More energy density, obviously, but also enabling faster charging and a greater range of operating temperatures. So pretty much great all the way around. It's also pretty new, so this is a bit of an expensive technology. So it's gonna be in flagships mostly to start, but this is the first part of a wave of new phones shipping with them. This will be great for small phones having better batteries. This will be great for folding phones like we've seen already with the Honor Magic V2, which is impossibly thin but has 5,000 milliamp-hours of capacity. And that is absolutely how we got this OnePlus 13 being thinner and lighter than the OnePlus 12, yet having a 10% larger battery. It was honestly hard to find a day to challenge it and try to drain the whole thing. The truth is, even with my high brightness use, plenty of multitasking, this is a two-day phone at 120 hertz, and I turned it up to high resolution. I had days of, like, hours of, you know, GPS navigation, high brightness, a whole bunch of stuff happening, Bluetooth streaming, a whole ton, and I'd end the day with six hours of screen-on time, and I'd still have 35% battery left. So I basically can't kill it in a day. It's sick. But when it finally does get low, it has 80-watt fast charging, so it can go from zero to 100 in 36 minutes, and it supports 50-watt wireless charging with the right charging pad. This is the best that smartphone batteries have been since the beginning of the modern smartphone. I promise this is a great battery, and there's gonna be a lot more like it. That's the exciting part. Hell yes! So that's number one, the battery. Number two is this new chip inside, as well. This is the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip in this phone. And, you know, this new chip comes out every year from Qualcomm, and a bunch of us flagships use it. And typically, we see, you know, 5% improvements here, 10% improvements there if we're lucky, and that's respectable. But this year the improvement over last year's best has been way bigger. It has a 31% higher CPU clock speed. It scored 36% higher on the AnTuTu benchmark, 44% higher on the single-core Geekbench. It jumps up 14% on 3DMark. Like, this thing is putting up Wilt Chamberlain numbers; I'm loving it. Now, if you're just opening up Instagram or flipping through emails, it kind of sounds like none of this is gonna matter, and you'd mostly be right. But I love to see this type of jump on both power and efficiency because it means if you're pushing a chip, it's been shown to hold high frame rates and high power outputs for longer without throttling. But if you aren't gaming and you are just bouncing around casual apps or scrolling Blue Sky or emailing or whatever, it turns out your battery efficiency gets much better, too. So this chip has been great in a couple of phones that it started to show up with late last year: ROG Phone 9 Pro, Red Magic 10 Pro, great performers, great gaming phones, but now it's gonna also start to show up in regular flagships. I'm pretty sure Galaxy S25 lineup's gonna have this chip, and it's gonna be great, too. So lots more phones to also have that this year. So number one is the battery; it's great. Number two is the chip; it's great. Number three, last but not least, is around the front, and it's this display. Holy nits! So I called this a record-breaking display earlier, which might not mean much because, you know, every year there's been a new record-breaking phone with the highest max nits. This is another one on that streak. 1,600 nits in high brightness mode, 4,500 nits peak brightness. And apparently, this is the world's first display that's gotten an A++ from DisplayMate, whatever that means. I feel like I'm getting DXOMark flashbacks here. What you really need to know is this is a big display that looks really good all of the time, and it achieves that because, on paper, it absolutely does not miss. It's 6.82 inches corner to corner; QHD+ resolution, so it's nice and sharp; 120-hertz LTPO. It's mostly flat with, like, just the very edges curving over just slightly. So I can forgive that. It has great viewing angles. And it just gets insanely bright from corner to corner, and it can get super dim, as well. Plus, it has 2,160 hertz high-frequency PWM dimming for those with sensitive eyes. And there's an ultrasonic fingerprint reader underneath that's crazy fast. And it also has a new glove mode for increased sensitivity while wearing thin gloves and Aqua Touch 2.0, which does a great job at keeping the screen responsive when there's water on it, which a lot of older phones struggle with. The peak brightness number, the 4,500 nits, you know, it's an impressive, very big number, but it doesn't really mean that much. It can't do that on all of the pixels at once. And also the OnePlus 12 had the same number. But it's more just about the crazy full-screen brightness. If you're out in the sun taking pictures, or if it's up in your dash, like, this screen gets insanely bright, and it's surrounded by basically no bezels that are even all the way around. What more could you ask for from a screen? So, look, I'm excited for a bunch of other phones to also be coming out this year with the same impressive big three that this phone has it. They can have this awesome battery, this great chip, and an incredible display. But what you may have also noticed is that is three of my five pillars of a great smartphone. The other two being build quality and cameras. And this phone does pretty good with those also. So I think the design and build is pretty nice. This is good hardware. There's three colors to pick from. And they do this thing where the base version, which is 900 bucks, is only available in the black, but then the upgraded one for 1,000 bucks you can get in any color, including this nice blue vegan microfiber leather. It's kind of soft to the touch, and I like it. But there's also still an alert slider on the flatter sides, which is a crowd favorite. I personally use it every day. The vibration motor inside is super good; it's really precise. And OnePlus has also hilariously leveled up their IP rating, their certification for water and dust resistance. It's not IP68; it's IP69. It's nice. Which means it can be not just submerged but also can sustain high-pressure water jets at extreme temperatures, which is crazy. And it's also funny because I remember a few years ago, OnePlus not wanting to pay for IP certification at all. So now they're on the total opposite end. This phone can survive the laundry or being in the dishwasher if that happens to you. Now, there's no Qi2 magnets built into this phone, but I really like what they've done with their cases. So they've got these official cases that have magnet rings in them, and they are basically the exact same diameter as MagSafe. So now this phone with this case on it works with all of my MagSafe accessories. And I know that might not seem like a big deal since most people buying this phone, you know, don't already have an iPhone and a bunch of iPhone accessories lying around. But what it does do is basically unlock a whole world of accessories for this phone. So with this case on, I've been using all my MagSafe phone mounts in the car or any MagSafe charger or dock. They all work and just lock right in firmly with the magnet. It's great. Maybe the only design downside that I don't like is the camera bump is kinda awkwardly slightly to one side, but that's not a huge deal. Speaking of cameras, though, that's the other pillar. And this phone has a solid set of cameras. It's definitely not its strength. And this is kind of, you've seen this before. This is the OnePlus story, where they have fast phones, super smooth, great charging, and all that, it's just the cameras are a notch below other flagships. It's not a bad camera; it's just if you're gonna have an awesome, specced-out flagship but also undercut the other flagships, then you gotta save a little money somewhere. So the OnePlus 13's primary camera is the 50-megapixel Sony LYT-808 sensor with an f/1.6 aperture, essentially the same as the OnePlus 12. It is clearly... Look, it's gathering a lot of light, and the pictures during daytime and in nice conditions are really nice. It's even good for a little soft depth of field with close-up subjects. And it does a good job of freezing moving action and has good autofocus. It's just that performance drops extra hard when the light goes away, which feels like an obvious statement. It's like saying a tire loses traction when the ground is wet, but it's just a little worse than other competing flagships here. So it gets a little softer, gets a little HDR-y more often with lights, and is definitely a victim of the make-every-dark-photo-look-bright syndrome that we've observed in a lot of phones in the past. Rarely is anything actually in a deep shadow with this type of processing. And then there's also a 50-megapixel ultra-wide and a 50-megapixel, 3X tri-prism telephoto camera, which offers some space savings over a periscope zoom, but that's about it. And their performance in the dark is worse than the main camera. Video quality is definitely passable, though. I like that basically every new flagship phone now can shoot 4K60 from all three lenses, and this one can also shoot 8K30 from the main camera. This is the fifth generation of this OnePlus/Hasselblad partnership. And I remember when it first got announced back in the day and people were wondering if this is gonna be anything special or if it was more along the same lines of what we've seen from, like, Sony and Zeiss or Xiaomi and Leica. And to be honest, apart from, you know, some portrait mode stuff and the orange shutter button and a few tweaks to their pro mode, honestly, it's turned out to be right in line with those. There wasn't some dramatic reinventing of color science or suddenly a huge revolutionary new sensor, but it's just a little bit better than before. It's fine. I mean, people, again, you're not buying this phone just for this camera, but it's not a disaster. It'll hold up, and it'll be fine. Now, something you might have noticed, AI is not yet one of my pillars of a great smartphone. It's not really close to the list yet, but it is in some of this OS. There are some features with AI built-in; in the camera and some operating system stuff. But honestly, the OS is more important. You could argue that could be a pillar, and I think some people will buy this phone just for the OS. And I think they'd be right. OxygenOS 15 is still so fast and smooth and brings Android 15 features and a tiny bit of a coat of fresh paint over a lot of things along with some, shall we say, familiar elements. Like they added this little Dynamic Island copycat feature. So, hey, if you liked Apple's Dynamic Island, well, you'll feel right at home with the OnePlus 13. They're actually called Live Alert capsules, but it also literally shows up in settings if I search Island. So  I think they know what they're doing. But anytime music is playing or if you have a hotspot or a screen recording going on, this little bubble pops up around the selfie camera, and then you can tap it to bring up a card with the controls for that activity, and then you can always long press to jump into the app itself. So look, if you're gonna copy stuff, copy the good stuff, right? Also, I have to at least take a second, and I don't know how to feel about this yet. Maybe I'm curious what your takes are on this. But there's this whole genre of phone testing videos I've seen mostly on Twitter where all they really do is they just open and close apps super, super fast, a bunch of them in a row, just to test the animations like this. And a part of me is like, what? That's not how anyone uses their phones. Like, who cares? I wouldn't have known if my phone passed that test or failed, whatever. But also, OnePlus has specifically seen those tests and optimized this phone, changed the animations, to do really well on that test now. So here's the Galaxy S24 Ultra doing this and the OnePlus 13. I promise it's not something I would take into consideration when buying a phone, and I don't think I'd even notice it for everyday stuff, but I guess it's impressive that they've done it. They've optimized this animation chain. Thanks? Honestly, though, as a whole, OxygenOS on this phone, it's gonna be pretty familiar to anyone who's used any previous OnePlus phones or Oppo phones with a couple AI features sprinkled in now. Like, I still think Circle to Search is awesome. There's also an AI editor in the stock camera app now with things like AI Unblur and Reflection Eraser, and Detail Booster, some of which work okay sometimes, but also other times they're still very obviously AI and not that good, and all of which require an internet connection to work. And there's also some writing features that can do things like summarizing or adjusting tone or proofreading text, but it only works in the OnePlus Notes app, which is a fine app, but it would've been nice if it worked in other places, too. And it also requires an internet connection. They usually call me a bit of a skeptic on a lot of these AI features actually being useful. But in general, like I said, the software, smooth, super fast. It's really good. And it will be a reason why some people would buy this phone over, say, a Vivo flagship, for example. Well, that and the price. But yeah, OnePlus trying to undercut other flagships by being slightly cheaper than them. We've seen it before; that's their formula, and they're sticking to it. But I'm excited about the fact that everyone else can also stick to their formula this year, and it still means we're gonna get much better batteries, chips, and displays across the board. So I think we're winning here. Sick. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one.

So new console season has always been interesting because yeah, of course we want the new one to be higher fidelity and better in every way than the old one. But if you only play ""Forza,"" then you were never gonna buy a Switch in the first place. But if you really wanna play ""Mario Kart World,"" well then, you were only ever gonna buy a Switch. So it's not about the hardware itself, this thing is just a vehicle for playing the games. It's all about the games. So what am I doing here? So I'm a tech reviewer that happens to play games sometimes. I don't get a lot of downtime, but when I do, I'm watching YouTube videos and then occasionally playing a few of my favorite games, usually on PlayStation. Some ""2K"" here and there, the ""Spider-Man"" game. So hearing what I have to say about the Switch might not seem that interesting. But you know what's more interesting? The fact that this is a second generation product. I've said this many times. The second generation product is always the most interesting. See, when Nintendo launched the first Switch in 2017, the concept was pretty novel. Look, most video game consoles are either a sit down at the couch console, like a PlayStation or an Xbox, or they're a handheld on the go console, like the Nintendo 3DS or a PS Vita. So Nintendo comes along with this fun idea of a console that can switch back and forth between a handheld console with nice screen and controls built in and a sit down console with removable controls, so you can be on the couch and play it on a TV. It's like a two-in-one. It's risky, but the value proposition was pretty obvious and it happened to take off. I always say the second generation of a product is the most interesting though because that's when you get to see them, like, pick a direction and move forward with all the things they learned from trying this new idea. Nintendo basically has replaced both the Wii U, TV console, and the 3DS, handheld console, with one thing. So the Switch is successful as a two-in-one, which is great. But now think about designing a two-in-one console. Do you wanna, you know, bias it a little bit more towards mostly handheld use? You think that that's what it should be good at? Or do you think people will mostly use it docked to a TV so you kind of lean more towards that direction? Or do you try to ride the line down the middle and try to be good at both? 'Cause two-in-ones of anything are rarely good at both. And it turns out, people who got the Switch switched back and forth a lot. Like there's some investor briefings that say something like 50% of Switch users do a lot of both handheld and TV gaming. And then slightly more people are mostly handheld versus mostly docked. But this is a healthy mix. So for the slightly larger group that's almost always using the thing handheld, they've clearly focused on improving that experience a lot for the Switch 2. This is a massive new screen. It's brighter, higher refresh rate, still has decent sized bezels but generally looks much better up close than the original. The joy-cons also, huge improved, full width kickstand, even over the Switch OLED. But then for docked gaming, whether it's for more immersive longer sessions or multiplayer gaming or just for better fidelity, they've clearly improved that experience too. The dock does 4K60 now instead of 1080. It can do HDR output. There's now a cooling fan, so performance stays better for longer gaming sessions. And they threw a USB type C port at the top of the console so you can plug in extra accessories even while it's docked. Also adding ethernet built right to the dock, probably after seeing a ton of people add it with an adapter, underrated. So if the mission was to make the Switch 2 better for both handheld only people and docked only people, I think they can claim to actually be successful here. Which also means that the people who switch back and forth regularly also win. Especially because the mechanism for switching is the most improved part of this console. These new joy-cons with their bigger buttons, bigger joysticks, but also the extremely satisfying magnets, this is what makes the Switch the Switch, and I think they've nailed this part. Instead of sliding off on rails, which is already pretty innovative in 2017, now it's magnets. It's just pushing this little button to start a separation and then pulling them apart and then reconnecting them is even easier with this nice color matching animation and a sound that goes with it. Niceties, that's a fun word, and it means exactly what it sounds like. Any new thing like this is gonna have its upsides. And there's also some downsides, which I'll get to, trust me, but the Switch 2's updates go beyond just the classic gen two improvements. Like I said, the joy-cons are really what make the Switch, the Switch, and I think that was their number one learning from the first generation. That's why they're bigger, built better. The SR and SL buttons are way more usable for those two player games where you're actually using those. It's dramatically more comfortable. The magnets are great. But also, mouse mode is a new thing, and it's interesting, it doesn't actually do anything in most of the games I happen to play, but it is responsive and ridiculously easy to activate. It works well on different types of surfaces, including my pants leg, but like I said at the beginning, it's all about the games and you know there will be games eventually that support this to a deeper level than just clicking through menus. Like I keep coming back to that wheelchair soccer game I saw a few weeks ago when I played it at that demo. That's still all I've been able to try with it so far. But this definitely leaves the door open for some more potentially really interesting stuff in the future. And then the other obvious nicety is literally just performance. New console means new compute, even if you're not playing new games. Just seeing the games you're already used to on a bigger screen at a higher refresh rate is already a pretty sick update. There's been some pretty detailed testing now of different games that were limited on the Switch 1 seeing way more consistent frames on the Switch 2, even without any updates, which is pretty sick. This game, ""Bomb Rush Cyberfunk,"" was getting like 24 to 30 ish frames per second on the Switch 1, looking kind of choppy sometimes. Now it's locked at 60 FPS on the Switch 2. It's so much better. Now ""Resident Evil 5"" is another one. It looks, you know, decent on the Switch 1, but typically runs anywhere from 30 to 40 FPS. But again, the Switch 2 can run it at a clean 60. Doesn't even blink, no questions asked. So yes, moving through menus is faster and going through the eShop is actually kind of snappy and launching games is quicker. All that stuff is to be expected and it's nice. But there's also that sort of bonus element of if you are a Switch 1 gamer, then even without buying any new games, the Switch 2 kind of breathes new life into a lot of your previous games, for a price. The truth is, the battery life is the only real major weak point I've been able to find with the Switch 2 in my testing. And in hindsight, it probably shouldn't be a big surprise, 'cause when you take a small, handheld console and give it an even bigger display and even more frames per second and an even more powerful chip, of course battery life can't possibly be amazing. My bottom line is it's very similar to the first Switch. Sometimes a little better, but sometimes worse. Standby time when it's just sitting around doing nothing, is fine, it's around the same, sometimes a little better than before. But if you really get into a game, like a high intensity game with high brightness and just play for a while, you will see the battery percentage plummet fast. Like sometimes dropping 1% literally every two minutes. So it'll fly from 100 to zero in like three hours. So when you're away from an outlet, not so great. Like I was hoping maybe on like a four or five hour longer flight, I'd be able to just use this thing the whole time and not really think too hard about it. But you do have to think about it. So that's a bummer. But the downside that's getting talked about way more is the price. So the the price tag for the new Switch 2 is $450. So if you remember the first Switch, that launched at $300, so it's a 50% increase in price from the last generation. And so that feels like a lot, but my take is that's, it's actually not that bad. 'Cause keep in mind, one, that first first Switch came out in 2017. So adjusted for inflation, that's almost $400 in today's money. But then also, it's been eight years since that original console came out. So eight years later, getting an updated version with a bigger, better display and better compute and all this re-engineering and the new joy-cons and magnets and all that doesn't feel that crazy, if you're gonna have this for four to five years at a time. In a world where we also have like a new $1,000 smartphone every single year, this feels maybe more aligned with the market. So the console's price got talked about a lot. In my opinion, that was a little bit overblown. But what's not overblown is everything else around the console also getting more expensive. Like microSD Express cards are faster and way better performing to launch games off of, but they are more expensive for sure. Accessories across the board have also creeped up in price and games are also more expensive, up to 60, 70, $80 for a single game. Even the ""Welcome Tour"" game, which is not as good, by the way, as the free PS5 ""Astro's Playroom"" demo, it's $9 for some reason. And it looks even worse when some game cartridges you buy are just keys, but you still need an internet connection to download the rest of the game files before you can actually play them. It's crazy. The reason they do that is because some games apparently are too big to fit entirely on one cartridge. So they split it up and here's a key with some files and then download some others. But yeah, it looks, you can see how the headline would be kind of tough there. So if you're buying a game, like a physical one, make sure you then go and install all the rest of the stuff you need while you have an internet connection so you don't fire it up for the first time offline on a plane and realize you don't have the whole thing. Anyway. Now, I also should mention, stick drift. So this didn't happen on mine, but one of the most common issues with the original Switch was these joysticks starting to drift after a while. And everyone kind of assumed since it was such a big issue that Nintendo obviously knows about this and would fix it with hall effect sensors in the Switch 2. But these new sticks are not, in fact, hall effect. So will these also start to have drift issues over time? Unknown. Only time will tell. So like I said at the beginning, if you're in a purchase decision here watching this video, it really comes down to the games. Like which games do you wanna play? If you're a ""Call of Duty"" person, you were never gonna buy a Switch 2. But if you love Mario games or Zelda or Pokemon, well then, here we are. It's still early in the cycle, so people getting Switches now, you'll notice there's not really that many new games made specifically for the Switch 2 yet, but I mean ""Mario Kart World"" is by far and away the most popular one. So you might as well get the bundle, which is 500 bucks and then you save your $30 there. But from there, it's choose your own adventure. This plus a wall plug will be your vessel for whatever games you play for the next four years. Now you might have also noticed I've been using a lot during this video actually these color matching joy-con skins from channel sponsored Dbrand. Pretty sick. But a few of us around the office have also been using their new Killswitch case since the impressions video a couple weeks ago. Best part is probably these ergonomic hand grips on the joy-cons. Major key if you're one of the people planning on going handheld with it a lot. And like I said in the review, I appreciate bigger joy-cons this time around, but the shape is still not ideal for super long gaming sessions. So the grips on the Killswitch solve that. This super ergonomic handle feels like it was actually made for human hands. Now if you're wondering how any of this is supposed to fit inside the OEM dock, well it doesn't, but Dbrand includes a dock adapter with every order that gives full 4K60 pass through and then doesn't affect any of the console or dock cooling. But the other thing I think you guys will appreciate is this travel cover. So if you're going somewhere with your Switch 2, pop it in, this little bungee cover over the back secures it in place and then the front's protected, so it's not going anywhere. Plus it lets you store 10 games on the inside of this travel cover shell. And then last but not least, considering Switch 2's got a non-removable plastic film applied over the glass that gets scratched super easily, you'll probably wanna pick up a screen protector. Dbrand's Prism is super easy to install. It comes in a two pack and if you grab it alongside the Killswitch, you'll save 35 bucks. So if you already have a Switch 2 or if you're gonna get one, I highly recommend checking out the Dbrand stuff. Link will be below. Anyway, I'm gonna get back to playing some ""Backyard Baseball."" Thanks for watching. Catch you guys on the next one. Peace. - Game console reviews are funny because the reason you're gonna buy a console is almost never about the actual hardware, it's about the games. So new console season has always been interesting because yeah, of course we want the new one to be higher fidelity and better in every way than the old one. But if you only play ""Forza,"" then you were never gonna buy a Switch in the first place. But if you really wanna play ""Mario Kart World,"" well then, you were only ever gonna buy a Switch. So it's not about the hardware itself, this thing is just a vehicle for playing the games. It's all about the games. So what am I doing here? So I'm a tech reviewer that happens to play games sometimes. I don't get a lot of downtime, but when I do, I'm watching YouTube videos and then occasionally playing a few of my favorite games, usually on PlayStation. Some ""2K"" here and there, the ""Spider-Man"" game. So hearing what I have to say about the Switch might not seem that interesting. But you know what's more interesting? The fact that this is a second generation product. I've said this many times. The second generation product is always the most interesting. See, when Nintendo launched the first Switch in 2017, the concept was pretty novel. Look, most video game consoles are either a sit down at the couch console, like a PlayStation or an Xbox, or they're a handheld on the go console, like the Nintendo 3DS or a PS Vita. So Nintendo comes along with this fun idea of a console that can switch back and forth between a handheld console with nice screen and controls built in and a sit down console with removable controls, so you can be on the couch and play it on a TV. It's like a two-in-one. It's risky, but the value proposition was pretty obvious and it happened to take off. I always say the second generation of a product is the most interesting though because that's when you get to see them, like, pick a direction and move forward with all the things they learned from trying this new idea. Nintendo basically has replaced both the Wii U, TV console, and the 3DS, handheld console, with one thing. So the Switch is successful as a two-in-one, which is great. But now think about designing a two-in-one console. Do you wanna, you know, bias it a little bit more towards mostly handheld use? You think that that's what it should be good at? Or do you think people will mostly use it docked to a TV so you kind of lean more towards that direction? Or do you try to ride the line down the middle and try to be good at both? 'Cause two-in-ones of anything are rarely good at both. And it turns out, people who got the Switch switched back and forth a lot. Like there's some investor briefings that say something like 50% of Switch users do a lot of both handheld and TV gaming. And then slightly more people are mostly handheld versus mostly docked. But this is a healthy mix. So for the slightly larger group that's almost always using the thing handheld, they've clearly focused on improving that experience a lot for the Switch 2. This is a massive new screen. It's brighter, higher refresh rate, still has decent sized bezels but generally looks much better up close than the original. The joy-cons also, huge improved, full width kickstand, even over the Switch OLED. But then for docked gaming, whether it's for more immersive longer sessions or multiplayer gaming or just for better fidelity, they've clearly improved that experience too. The dock does 4K60 now instead of 1080. It can do HDR output. There's now a cooling fan, so performance stays better for longer gaming sessions. And they threw a USB type C port at the top of the console so you can plug in extra accessories even while it's docked. Also adding ethernet built right to the dock, probably after seeing a ton of people add it with an adapter, underrated. So if the mission was to make the Switch 2 better for both handheld only people and docked only people, I think they can claim to actually be successful here. Which also means that the people who switch back and forth regularly also win. Especially because the mechanism for switching is the most improved part of this console. These new joy-cons with their bigger buttons, bigger joysticks, but also the extremely satisfying magnets, this is what makes the Switch the Switch, and I think they've nailed this part. Instead of sliding off on rails, which is already pretty innovative in 2017, now it's magnets. It's just pushing this little button to start a separation and then pulling them apart and then reconnecting them is even easier with this nice color matching animation and a sound that goes with it. Niceties, that's a fun word, and it means exactly what it sounds like. Any new thing like this is gonna have its upsides. And there's also some downsides, which I'll get to, trust me, but the Switch 2's updates go beyond just the classic gen two improvements. Like I said, the joy-cons are really what make the Switch, the Switch, and I think that was their number one learning from the first generation. That's why they're bigger, built better. The SR and SL buttons are way more usable for those two player games where you're actually using those. It's dramatically more comfortable. The magnets are great. But also, mouse mode is a new thing, and it's interesting, it doesn't actually do anything in most of the games I happen to play, but it is responsive and ridiculously easy to activate. It works well on different types of surfaces, including my pants leg, but like I said at the beginning, it's all about the games and you know there will be games eventually that support this to a deeper level than just clicking through menus. Like I keep coming back to that wheelchair soccer game I saw a few weeks ago when I played it at that demo. That's still all I've been able to try with it so far. But this definitely leaves the door open for some more potentially really interesting stuff in the future. And then the other obvious nicety is literally just performance. New console means new compute, even if you're not playing new games. Just seeing the games you're already used to on a bigger screen at a higher refresh rate is already a pretty sick update. There's been some pretty detailed testing now of different games that were limited on the Switch 1 seeing way more consistent frames on the Switch 2, even without any updates, which is pretty sick. This game, ""Bomb Rush Cyberfunk,"" was getting like 24 to 30 ish frames per second on the Switch 1, looking kind of choppy sometimes. Now it's locked at 60 FPS on the Switch 2. It's so much better. Now ""Resident Evil 5"" is another one. It looks, you know, decent on the Switch 1, but typically runs anywhere from 30 to 40 FPS. But again, the Switch 2 can run it at a clean 60. Doesn't even blink, no questions asked. So yes, moving through menus is faster and going through the eShop is actually kind of snappy and launching games is quicker. All that stuff is to be expected and it's nice. But there's also that sort of bonus element of if you are a Switch 1 gamer, then even without buying any new games, the Switch 2 kind of breathes new life into a lot of your previous games, for a price.

そして追加のバ ッテリーまで。 とにかく、 もう数えきれないほどの追 加要素が満載なんです。 これがOnePlus 15です。 さて、 今年の初めに出た OnePlus 13はすごく気に入ってて、 動画も一本丸々作 ったくらいです。 で、 もちろん14はスキ ップされました。 四は超不吉な数 字ですからね。 そして今回登場した のがOnePlus 15で、 僕が期待してたのは、 ちょっとしたスペックアッ プくらいのものでした。 それが普通ですから。 OnePlusは以 前にもやってます。 Tバージョンのスマホ を出してた頃ですね。 半年後にはスマホを リフレッシュして、 新しいチップをい ち早く搭載して、 自慢の種にする、みたいな。 正直、 それだけでも十分でした。 新しいSnapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5は本当にすごい。 八 Eliteより二〇から 四〇パーセント高速で、 マルチコア性能は記録的！ クロック周波数は四 点六ギガヘルツ？！ 正直、 これだけでもう十分でした。 このままで十分だったのに、 彼らは満足せず、 さらにやりすぎな要素を大 量に詰め込んだんです。 正直、 マニアでも気づかない、 気にしないような、 細かいことばかり。 つまり、 MKBHDの動画を 熱心に見てくれる、 買わない人でも興 奮するような、 まさにそういう要素です。 この新しいチップと巨大なベ イパーチャンバーに加えて、 超高速なUFS 4.1ストレージも搭載。 ベースモデルは12ギ ガのLPDDR5X Ultra RAMを搭載。 これでも超高速ですが、 あなたには物足りないかも。 なのでアップグレード版は 16ギガのLPDDR5X Ultra Plus RAMを搭載。 -これ以上速いも のはありません。 --普通じゃないです。 もちろん、 デザインもアップデ ートされました。 よりシンプルに、 クリーンに、 そして角張ったデザ インになりました。 僕は好きですね。 側面やカメラバンプ、 基本的にすべて がフラットで角 張ったデザイン になりました。 中央のカメラがロ ゴを通してスマホ の中心と一直線に 並んでいるのが、 なんかいい感じです。 すっきりした全体 マット仕上げ。 背面も側面も光 沢は一切なし。 カラーは三色。 マットブラック、 マットサンド、 そしてユニークなマ ットバイオレット。 いいですね。 仮に、 新しいチップとこの 新しいデザイン、 それだけだったとしても、 数ヶ月後のスペック アップ版としては、 僕の期待通りだ ったでしょう。 でも、これは違います。 OnePlus 15ですから。 やりすぎ上等。 このスマホは全色、 マイクロアーク酸化 プロセスで新開発さ れた超タフな仕上げ が施されています。 要は、 金属の上にセラミックコー ティングを施すんです。 普段はそういうのを特に気に したりはしないんですが、 このマットブラックは、 今までスマホで見 てきた中で最も印 象的なマットブラ ックの一つです。 この微細なテク スチャは手触り が少し柔らかいだけでなく、 マットブラックって、 実は結構指紋が つきやすくて、 綺麗に保つのが少 し難しいんです。 認めます。 でも、 なぜかこれは全く指 紋がつきません。 それに普段、 マットブラック のものをカバン から出して傷がついてると、 ちょっと心が痛むんです。 それがこれにも起きて、 取り出したら傷がついてて、 もう最悪でした。 そしたら… その傷は、 実は毎回きれいに 拭き取れるものだ ったということに 気づいたんです。 実はその傷は、 カバンの中の他 の物の素材が、 このセラミック の表面に擦れて 付着したものだったんです。 ご存知の通り、 セラミックはモース硬度 で8か9くらいなので、 文字通りダイヤモン ドでもない限り、 それより柔らかいわけです。 このスマホは傷つけ られる側じゃなく、 むしろ他のものを傷 つける側なんです。 これは本当に普通 じゃないですよ。 「救急車を呼べ、 だが俺のためじゃな い」って感じです。 このコーティングが どれくらい厚いか、 JerryRigEvery thingのカッターテスト や大きな落下にどれだけ耐え られるかは分かりませんが、 普段使いの摩耗にはか なり強いと感じます。 それに加えて、IP66、 IP68、IP69、 そして今やIP69Kの防塵 防水性能も認証取得済み。 なので、 数分間水に沈めら れるだけでなく、 摂氏80度までの高 温高圧ジェット水を 近距離から噴射され ても耐えられます。 たぶん洗濯機で回して も大丈夫でしょう。 これも普通じゃないです。 それに、 OnePlusが長年、 数ドルの節約のため に公式のIP認証 取得を渋ってきた 歴史を考えると、 笑えます。 今や全部乗せですからね。 あ、ちなみに、 これだけのことをしながら、 OnePlus 13よりわずかに 薄くなっていて、 バッテリーは7,300ミリ アンペア時のシリコンカーボ ンバッテリーへと大幅にアッ プグレードされています。 今年のOnePlus 13は、 六千ミリアンペア時の 素晴らしいシリコン カーボンバッテリー で方向性を示した。 S25 Ultraや他 のフラッグシッ プ機を圧倒し絶賛されたが、 今回はもう馬鹿げている。 ほんの数年前の スマホと比べ、 文字通り二倍のバ ッテリー容量だ。 アノードのシリコン 含有量を増やし、 エネルギー密度をこれま でになく高めた結果だ。 ええ、 とにかくバッテリー が永遠に持ちます。 最近、 Waveformポ ッドキャストで、 僕がバッテリー ベンチマークを やらない理由を話しました。 実際の使用状況 を反映している ものがほとんど ないからです。 色々なことに最適化 できますからね。 でも、 7,300ミリアンペア 時のスマホがベンチマ ークで悪い結果を出すは ずがないだけでなく、 OnePlusは バックグラウンド タスクを積極的に 強制終了させて、 待機時間をうまく管理するこ とで有名な会社の一つです。 なので、 1回の充電でス クリーンオンタ イムが余裕で7から8時間、 1日で使い切るこ とはほぼ不可能、 というのも驚きで はありません。 ある時は1日の終わりに 50%くらい残ってて、 寝て起きても49%で、 丸々もう1日使え る状態でした。 それに、 急速充電器が同梱 されています。 悲しいことに、 これも普通じゃな くなりましたが、 アメリカでは80ワット で急速充電できます。 より強力なコンセ ントがある他の国 では100ワット に対応します。 おまけに50ワットの ワイヤレス充電も。 SuperVOOCなので、 充電器側はまだU SB-Aですが、 ケーブルも付いてくる ので気にしません。 バッテリー管理機 能もオンにでき、 充電容量を制限したり、 バイパス充電も可能です。 実際、 このスマホのバッテリー は非常に大きいので、 毎回85%に充電 を制限しても、 ちなみに、 そうする必要は ありませんが、 もし長期的なバッテ リーの健康を保証す るために85%に制 限したとしても、 それでもGalaxy S25 Ultraよりバッテリ ー容量は大きいんです。 さて、 ここ数年のスマホや PC業界の大きな話 題の一つがカスタム シリコンですが、 このスマホもそれ をやっています。 Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5搭載とは言いましたが、 OnePlusの「高速で スムーズ」という夢を助 けるカスタムチップが他に 二つ搭載されています。 新Wi-Fiチップと新 タッチ応答チップです。 Wi-Fiチップは、 Apple iPhone搭載 の新C1やC1X モデムに相当する と考えられます。 Qualcommの内 蔵モデムを使わず、 G2と名付けた自社開発 品を採用しています。 時々、 同じネットワーク 上の他のデバイス より速い速度が出 ることがある、 ということ以外はよ く分かりません。 でも、 タッチ応答チップは実 はもっとすごいです。 最大165ヘルツでリフ レッシュできる新しい ディスプレイと組み合 わせているからです。 でも、 165ヘルツにな るのは時々だけ。 面白いことに、 ディスプレイ設 定のリフレッシ ュレートで「高」にすると、 最大165ヘルツ と表示されます。 でも実際にスマホを 操作してみると、 ほとんどが1ヘルツ から120ヘルツ の間で動いている のが分かります。 スクロール中は120、 アプリ使用中も120、 マルチタスク中も120。 じゃあいつ165ヘ ルツになるのか？ ゲームの時だけです！ Call of Dutyやクラッシ ュ・オブ・クラン、 Real Racing 3のような対応ゲームを 開くとーリストがありま すーその時に165ヘル ツに跳ね上がります。 対応ゲームのリストは今の ところかなり短いですが、 これらの特定のゲームでは、 フレームレートが1 65に固定され、 維持されます。 なので、 120と165 の違いが見分け られるほど目が肥えていて、 お気に入りのゲーム でそれを気にする 特定のモバイルゲー マーにとっては、 間違いなくこのスマ ホがおすすめです。 僕はどちらかというと、 高リフレッシュレー トと高解像度を同 時に使えるだけで嬉 しいタイプです。 多くのスマホはどちらかを選 ばないといけませんからね。 そして専用のタッ チ応答チップは、 3,200ヘルツとい う馬鹿げたタッチサ ンプリングレートを 可能にしています。 参考までに、 普通のフラッグシップ 機はだいたい1,4 40ヘルツから2, 400ヘルツです。 なので、 これも明らかに普 通じゃないです。 ただ、 このスマホにも欠点 はいくつかあって、 その一つがこれです。 ええと、 小さなものがいくつかと、 本当に大きなものが一つ。 ディスプレイは技術的には、 時々リフレッシュレ ートが高くなり、 時々少し明るくなりますが、 解像度は以前よりわずか に低くなっています。 OnePlus 13は1440pでしたが、 OnePlus 15は横が127 2ピクセルです。 たぶん気づかないでしょう。 どちらも非常にシ ャープですから。 でもまあ、 このスマホの他の部分にも、 気づかないような小さなやり すぎ要素が多々あったので、 一応言っておきました。 OnePlusは、 個人的に大好きだ ったアラートス ライダーを廃止し 続けています。 代わりに、 カスタマイズ可能なボ タンが一つだけです。 ほとんどの人はこれで 満足するでしょう。 僕のように、 あれがなくて寂しいと 言う人も多いですが、 長押しでサイレントスイッチ にカスタマイズはできます。 でも、 画面をつけたりポケ ットから出さなくて も状態が分かるのが 本当に好きでした。 でももちろん、 他の便利な機能に割り当て る人もいるでしょうから、 良いでしょう。 触覚モーターも、 スペック上は十三からダウ ングレードされましたが、 絶対に気づかない と断言できます。 OnePlus 15の触覚フィードバック は今でも非常に良いです。 でも、 本当に大きな問題 はカメラです。 これはもう… ずっとOnePlus スマホの課題です。 いつも素晴らしい スペックとパフ ォーマンスのスマ ホを出すのに、 必ずカメラで失 敗するんです。 今回も、 「スマホは最高だけど、 カメラが最高じ ゃないだけ」と いうレベルではありません。 いえ、 これはかなり大幅なダ ウングレードです。 センサーは小さくなり、 絞りも小さくなり、 写真も動画も全体的に悪く、 がっかりする出来です。 背面には50メ ガピクセルのト リプルカメラシ ステムがあり、 期待できそうに 聞こえますが、 このメインセンサーの性能 が驚くほど低いんです。 実は400ドルのHonor 200と同じもので、 性能もそんな感じです。 他のフラッグシッ プ機なら問題ない ような中程度の明 るさの場面でも、 ノイズが目立ちます。 3.5倍の望遠と、 周辺が少し甘い116度 の超広角もありますが。 まあ、役には立ちます！ でも全体的に、 どのカメラで撮っても 色がくすんでいて、 ノイズが多くディテール に欠けると感じました。 それから、 もうお気づきかも しれませんが、 このスマホの背面 にはHasse lbladのロゴ がありません。 あのカメラパートナーシッ プは終わったようです。 オレンジ色のシャッタ ーボタンもなくなり、 XPanモードも なくなりました。 ただ、 プロモードはまだマスターモ ードと呼ばれていますし、 あの信じられない くらいうるさい リーフシャッター 音も健在です。 なので、 その痕跡を完全に消し去った わけではないようですね。 でも、ええ、 このスマホのパフォーマ ンスと使いやすさで、 これだけのこと、 やりすぎなことま でしてきたのに、 またしてもOneP lusスマホで、 カメラは再びがっか りさせられることを 受け入れなければな らない部分です。 まあ、 僕はこのOneP lusスマホを、 これまでの多くのOnePl usスマホと同じ理由で、 とても楽しく使いました。 とにかく高速でス ムーズなんです。 ソフトウェアが変わり、 OxygenOSがColo rOSのクローンになり、 それがまたiOSのクローン のようになってしまっても、 少なくとも、 ぬるぬるサクサクで機能 満載なのは変わらず、 自分好みに設定 できるカスタマ イズ性も十分に 残っています。 AI機能を使うかどうかも、 いつものように選べます。 僕は使いませんでした。 デフォルトの動作を調 整するかどうかも、 いつものように選べます。 僕はしました。 本当に安心して使 えるスマホです。 どんなに酷使しても、 どんなに無茶なことを させようとしても、 常に馬鹿みたいに 速く読み込んで、 一日中バッテリ ーが持ちます。 だから、そこは素晴らしい。 でも、ええ、 普通じゃないです。 このスマホは本当 に普通じゃなく、 細かいパフォーマンスは 高く評価しています。 でも、 カメラがここまで足 を引っ張るなら、 メイン機にするにはま だ道のりは長いです。 でも幸い、 価格は非常に競争 力があります。 このスマホは八九九ドル… --あの素晴らしい十六 ギガのLPDDR5X Ultra Plus RAMが欲しければ 九九九ドルです。 でも、ねえ… 本当に素晴らしい、 フラッグシップ級 のカメラを積んだ Ultraバージ ョンみたいなの、 作ってくれませんかね？ そうなったらもう最 高なんだけどな。 オーケー、ありがとう。 じゃあね。 ピース。","en","[]"

You know, people say beauty is in the eye of the beholder and stuff like that. I get it. You can find beauty in anything, for sure. But also, you know, there's a nice alignment to things that feels good. And you know, when things are, when things are where you expect them to be, doesn't that feel better? Okay. All right, carcinisation. I learned about this recently. This is a strange and odd but funny phenomenon and evolutionary biology where a bunch of undersea crustaceans have all slowly evolved towards the same, flat, robust, crab-like shape because it seems to be the ideal form factor for surviving in the ocean. Oversimplified, it feels like everything down there is evolving towards a crab. And look at all these crabs, lots of smartphones today basically look the same. So when something that comes along looks a little different, well it's gonna feel weird, isn't it? But hey, maybe someone's into the layered glass look with the text in various places. Maybe you're into the red dot turning into a functional record light. Maybe you're into a bit of a lobster. Real talk though, it feels like every few months Nothing comes out with a new product that looks crazy and people hate on all the pictures on the internet 'cause they look weird. And then two months later we're all used to it and we forget about the looks and we can focus on the product itself. So let's just skip all that and focus on the product. This is what Nothing is calling their first true flagship, which is what you would say if you're Nothing and you're charging $799 for a phone for the first time ever after rolling around in the budget and mid-range space for a few years. But I've been using this phone for the better part of the last week and I'm gonna disagree with the whole premise here actually. This is no more of a flagship phone than any of Nothing's previous phones. Now are they lying to us? Eh, not exactly but kind of. Hear me out. 799 is the same price as a Samsung Galaxy S25 or the Pixel 9, or right underneath the iPhone 16. Like they're competing against bonafide flagships from mega companies with basically unlimited money. And part of what we've come to expect from phones in this class is basically giving us the best available stuff. Like it's kind of this unspoken rule, but if you're spending this much, you deserve to just get the best parts, right? That's why it's been so easy for me to rag on like the Pixel in the past for not having the best performance or the iPhone for not having a high refresh rate display. So this Nothing Phone 3, it's certainly dressed up like a flagship and it is the most flagship yet of any Nothing phone. It is huge. It's got this super bright, high refresh rate, OLED display. It has a massive new silicon carbon battery, new triple 50 megapixel cameras, IP 68 certification, up to 16 gigs of RAM. Like it's got all the makings of what could be a flagship. But when you peel back the mask, just a little bit, like right under the surface, it's the same exact strategy that Nothing has been running on all their previous phones in the past. The playbook is to just cut back just a little bit from the highest end stuff in ways that hopefully you, the buyer, don't notice. And it still feels like a flagship, but that allows 'em to cut costs and undercut the competition a little bit. So it works. It's not a bad strategy. It's allowed 'em to make great phones in the past, but it's just harder to sell that strategy at this price. So for starters, the chip inside, right? It's not the expensive, proven, powerful flagship Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. This is running the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 instead. It's one of the first phones we've seen using this chip. And to be fair, it is much better than anything we've seen in any previous Nothing phone. It's a four nanometer chip, it's something like 40% better CPU and like 90% better GPU than the chip in the two year-old Nothing Phone 2. The phone is zippy and smooth as hell, basically all the time. And I'll get to the software experience in a second. But is it the best available? Well, technically no. The Snapdragon 8 Elite still smokes this. You can see benchmark scores, it's pretty clear that's still the flagship chip. Now you as the user might never notice that. In fact you probably wouldn't if you just used the phone side by side in a lot of random, normal activities. But if you happen to get into graphically intensive gaming or the most intense tasks, that's what separates a flagship from an upper mid-range chip. So for some context, some other phones using this chip, the Poco F7 and the Iqoo Neo 10, both of these are sub $500 phones. I also think they were very clever pairing it up with 12 gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of storage base. It's fast Ram, it's UFS 4.0 and then the upgraded version for 899 is 16 gigs of RAM and half a terabyte. Awesome to see that. But there is no 8 128 version. And I think if they did make one, that would probably be like 699, but they didn't. Now when we get to the outside of this phone, there is this, again, huge new AMOLED display. Surely it's a flagship display, right? It's gigantic. It's 6.67 inches corner to corner with perfectly even bezels all the way around, that takes extra work. It's a gorgeous AMOLED, nice color reproduction and it's also, it's a good amount over 1080P. It's nice and sharp, smooth with that dynamic refresh rate up to 120 hertz and it gets crazy bright, 1600 nits outdoors, 4,500 nits peak brightness with HDR. So the numbers on paper go crazy and it's just, it's such a nice screen to look at. I've loved using it. So what's the catch, Marques? Well one, you would literally never know this unless you check the spec sheet, but the glass protecting the front of this display, it's Gorilla Glass 7i, and that is a mid-range glass in their lineup where you might see flagships using the more durable Gorilla Glass Victus or Victus 2. And normally I wouldn't even bring that up but that's definitely something to consider on a phone that is meant to spend a lot of its time face down. And then another thing, there are a lot of like really nice, subtle things that go into this screen. Like it has a 1,000 hertz touch sample rate, so it's even more responsive than the phone too. It also has 2160 hertz PWM dimming and it also has a very acceptable optical fingerprint reader down near the bottom. But it's also an LTPS display, instead of the most premium LTPO. And all that really means in practice is instead of varying a refresh rate from one to 120 hertz, it can go from 30 to 120 hertz. You would never notice, but it does mean a little bit worse power efficiency. I'll tell you what though, it can actually absolutely handle the slightly worse power efficiency because the battery in this phone is elite. It's marketed as a 5100 50 milliamp power battery, but according to Nothing and it gets complicated but it's actually rated at a 5,500 milliamp power battery. It's silicon carbon, it charges extra fast at 65 watts. It supports wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, reverse wired charging. It's great. It sips power in standby and it's genuinely a two day phone if you want it to be, even without the more efficient Snapdragon 8 Elite. So honestly flagship battery for sure. So then, okay, what about the cameras? Triple 50 megapixel cameras feels pretty flagship. And you know what, again, it is closer to a flagship than any previous Nothing phone has ever been, but I've used this now for a little bit. It's still a notch behind the S25's and Pixel 9's and iPhone 16's of the world. The mainstream flagships that I'm comparing this to. This main sensor is the biggest they've ever used, one over 1.3 inches. It lets a ton more light in and I'm shooting with this and I realize as I'm looking through all the pictures I've taken, for some reason it's frequently soft. Like even on a perfectly normal shot, the colors will be fine, the exposure will be fine, but the subject of the photo when I zoom in, it should be in sharp focus but it's just a little bit off. I think you can blame this a little bit on auto focus, maybe a little bit on tuning for a larger sensor with shallower depth of field. It's definitely capable of good pictures and it's a little bit wider than you might expect, but yeah, that's a little bit odd. Then the telephoto is 3x, also a tiny bit soft sometimes, but also very useful. It's where your macro shots come from and you can get some really sick, impressive closeups and the ultra wide and the selfie cameras, they are the most consistent and most flagship of them all. But yeah, like I said, the whole camera setup is just one notch behind those things. And you may only notice if you're zooming in and pixel peeping. But again, that's the point. Mostly good enough for most people, most of the time. I think with a little tuning, this can be an A minus camera. I think a perfect encapsulation of the priorities of this phone are, I mean look at, look at this design. It's an insane design but technically no camera bump. I mean the rings obviously protrude a little bit, but most flagship phones at this point also have some sort of big camera bump that they all sit on. It turns out to get this whole big telephoto camera to not have a bump that actually engineered part of the PCV or the board inside to have a hole in it. So the optics could actually split like punch through the PCB instead of being stacked totally on top of it. I'm sure we'll see this in like a JerryRigEverything tear down video at some point. But yeah, basically mission accomplished, no camera bump, but that also meant they had to use some smaller parts to make it work. And this is actually a physically smaller telephoto than the cheaper Nothing Phone 3a Pro. So spoiler, the design is still the priority of this phone, always has been. But let's talk about the most controversial bit of this design, which is the glyphs, which made Nothing Phones famous for a couple years. This year, the glyph lights are gone and replacing them is this small display on the back upper corner of the phone. It's 489 LED pixels. They're calling it Glyph Matrix. On its face, this has some usefulness about it, but then it's also surrounded by gimmicks. Okay, so the basic idea is like your phone is face down and then the lights on the back would light up and you could tell something about what that notification is to decide if you wanna actually pick it up and check or not. So if that is all you're after, then okay, success, you know, more pixels means more information. The new essential notifications builder is super powerful and informative. It's better than ever before. I can set up a certain icon to come up in the dots whenever I get a certain type of notification or anything from a certain person or from a certain app. Let's say I wanna be able to leave my phone face down, but I never wanna miss any notifications from Mom, ever. Okay, set that up. No matter what she sends, no matter how she sends it, I will get an icon or a picture from my gallery or something that it can turn into dots and done. Anytime mom calls or texts or whatever, I can't see what they said, but I can see that she sent me something. So that's convenient, that's functional. Outside of that, it immediately starts feeling way more gimmicky, like, okay, take another look at the back of this phone, you see a, you see this little dot here hidden in this design? This little circle is actually a pressure sensitive area. And when you press that, the back display lights up and then you can use a single press to cycle through these glyph toys and then a long press to actually engage with them. So you can cycle to a timer and then start a timer on the back of your phone, which doesn't sync up with the actual clock app. So if you turn your phone screen on the timer disappears. So be careful. You can also use the back display as a viewfinder for your main camera kind of, or you can play spin the bottle. Maybe you're into that. Maybe you and your friends don't have a bottle handy, but you have your Nothing phone. Or you can play Rock, Paper, Scissors against your own phone. I think you get the idea. They're fun tech demos, but the utility runs out real quick. Now they have opened up the API. So developers, if they want to, can make more stuff for the back screen. I, you know, with this phone, I don't really know how many actually will, like, is Spotify gonna make like album art, cover art on the back of the phone here? I don't know. But the Nothing community has already started developing some stuff and messing with it. They've made this one. This is a magic eight ball. So instead of turning your phone over and asking Google for a magic eight ball, you can ask the back of your phone and it'll give you a little message. Cool. Look, the real best part of a Nothing phone is still the software on the front of the phone because Nothing OS 3.5, soon to be updated to 4.0, it's just great. Like they have this tastefully modified version of Android with this nice aesthetic, finely-tuned, smooth performance and a handful of useful features that they just sort of sprinkle in there. So you can sort of choose which ones you want to use or easily ignore. The AI-powered essential space continues to evolve and get more features, though it doesn't sync with anything externally. So I don't use it. And yes, there's still a custom button for it on the side of the phone, but it's not too in-your-face. You can ignore it if you don't wanna use it. And the little things like being able to resize the quick settings toggles or the way you can swipe up on the camera app to flip through presets, which is so clean. Everything is, it's clean, it's smoothly animated and the whole OS is responsive in ways that feel higher end than the specs would ever suggest. I think the best new feature on this phone is the universal search box. So you might actually kind of get it confused 'cause there's a permanent Google search box on the bottom of the home screen at all times. Not that search box, but when you pull up the app drawer, that search box. Now, that one searches through your stuff on your phone, like usual, or you can ask it a question and hit that AI button and it'll use a modified version of Gemini to go online and pull up a short and sweet answer for you. It's tuned to kind of just be brief and give you answers to stuff. It's nice. And again, you can choose to use it or just never even try. You can just leave it tucked away and it's just, you can use it the way you normally do and just search for your apps on your phone. And this is also gonna get updates. They are gonna do, they're promising five years of major software updates. I could do the nitpicky thing and be like, oh, Samsung's doing seven years and Apple does even more. So it's not quite a flagship, but you've seen how flagships kind of vary all over the board. So I'm giving them flagship credit for the software. So at the end of the day, is the title of this review a little dramatic maybe? Sure. But flagship, the word flagship is being used here heavily as a marketing term. And so maybe the review title should just been Nothing Phone 3, They Did Marketing, whatever. But the point is, it still stands. They're charging 799 for this phone and there are other really good phones that you can get for that much money. So this phone, just like previous Nothing Phones is the one that you would get if you really care, not so much about raw specs, but about good software and a unique design. You don't want another crab, you want lobster. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys the next one.

And I've done my best to never quote these pre-briefings, and I'll do my best with my own testing and observations to make my own video, but I'm gonna break that rule just for this real quick, because I was on the briefing for the new Apple headphones, or new Powerbeats, and they said something that I thought was really interesting. They said that the Powerbeats Pro are the most popular best-selling headphones in the world. Now, I have not been able to verify this, and I have no way that I have found to confidently check those exact sales numbers, but if I was guessing, I would've thought that either, you know, base AirPods, maybe, or some super cheap, highly ranking buds on Amazon would be the best-selling headphones. So I mean, I guess I could believe it. But the point isn't necessarily if they're the number one headphones or not. The point that was interesting to me is that these are clearly very successful headphones that were $250 when they came out, so they must be at least pretty good. And so the hype has been real for the sequels, because the originals came out about five years ago. And so now that the 2's came out, and I've been using 'em for about a week now, I gotta say, I think these are going to continue to be some of the best-selling headphones in the world, because they're actually really good. So, let's just imagine for a second that they're right, and these are actually the number one best-selling headphones in the world. That means that Beats took the best-selling headphones in the world and added active noise cancellation and transparency mode and heart rate tracking, and made them smaller and lighter with better battery life, with better sound, made them more comfortable, and put them all in a smaller case that also has more battery and USB Type-C and wireless charging, and all for the same price. That's a hell of a refresh to me. I feel like Apple should be taking notes. To me, this is more clearly than ever better than AirPods Pro at more things than ever. So, easily my favorite part of the Powerbeats Pro 2 is just how they're built and how they stay in my ears. So, this was also true about the last ones, and it's true again. The rubber tips actually come in one extra size now, too, so there's extra small through extra large. And then the new ear hook is nice and snug, but not too snug. It just, it really feels natural and comfortable, holding everything in place. Plus, they are 20% lighter than the last generation. I think if we're being honest, these became so popular because they are basically the defacto premium workout headphones. And so depending on your workout, you're gonna be moving your head around a lot or a little bit, and it's gonna be important for these to stay in your ear. And yeah, these stay in my ears so well. And this is generally gonna be true about anything with the hooks over the ears versus anything without the hooks over the ears. I know wingtips are decent for some people. But AirPods Pro kind of fit in my ear well. These are a lock. And then what's different about the Beats headphones with hooks is, well, Apple owns Beats, so they've put the H2 chip in here and they do all the Appley things. It still does the instant pairing thing on any iPhone. Still very easy to pair with any Android phone, too. But, you know, instantly showing up on every device in your iCloud account is very convenient for a lot of people. Adding noise cancellation is huge though. Now, I don't think you can sell a $250 pair of wireless premium earbuds and not have noise cancellation in 2025, so maybe they felt forced to add it, but either way, they've done a really good job with these. It's sampling the outside world 200 times per second and does a really good job canceling white noise, the sort of basic steady state stuff. I think some stuff like keyboard typing and basic dialogue or other random sounds still get through, but once you have music playing, basically everything that's not the music fades completely away, which is the goal. Transparency mode is also really good. Not quite as good as AirPods Pro, which I think are the industry best, but this is closer than anything else has gotten for me. In fact, overall assessment would be that noise cancellation is really good, but a smidge below AirPods Pro, and transparency mode is also really good, but a smidge below AirPods Pro, so that makes sense 'cause they all have the H2 chip in them. But then the sound character, just the way they sound, it's just overall exactly what you're looking for from workout headphones. I mean, take the Beats logo off of these and listen to 'em, and you'd find that they're objectively pretty good sounding. They're like an eight outta 10 for sound quality. They're like AirPods plus a bit more bass and a little more volume and energy. On a technical level, they are upgraded amplifiers. There is new acoustically transparent mesh and a slight change to the alignment of the drivers to better point directly into your ears. Plus there's a new venting channel straight through the buds to relieve pressure and improve bass response. All of this stuff adds up to a really lively and fun and just good sounding pair of headphones. I'm not interested in a flat sound signature here. If I wanted that, I would get, you know, an Audio-Technica set or something like that. This is just, I'm guessing if you're working out, you're listening to some energetic music, some hip hop, some pop, some electro, whatever you're into, and these sound great with all of that stuff. Now, another valid question, if these are your only headphones, is would you fly with these? And yeah, I think you could. Again, it's gonna be best with that solid-state, steady noise. So, an airplane sound, you put them in, you turn ANC on, and it immediately drops it a lot. You could get better noise canceling out of certain other earbuds, but I find, like, having a hook on it and making sure it stays in my ear is even more important on a plane, 'cause when they fall out, it's a huge pain in the ass. So, yeah, I like these for flying. Oh, and also, the H2 chip means personalized spatial audio as well, if you're into that. But these, these also have another feature that I haven't seen in any other earbuds before, and that is heart rate tracking. Now, again, these are workout headphones, so that makes sense. I've just never seen that before. But the Powerbeats Pro 2 will do heart rate measuring through this little sensor right here. They will update heart rate every five seconds with technology borrowed from the Apple Watch, parsing data from each earbud at once. And you can even pair the earbuds to gym equipment so that if you have, like, a treadmill that has a Bluetooth connection, you can have your heart rate from your earbuds show up there, just like you could with an Apple Watch. I think that is a really cool, convenient thing to add for headphones that you know that people mostly work out in. I wasn't really sure exactly what to make of how accurate exactly the data's gonna be from them. I mean, it's still an optical sensor after all. I think what said the most to me is that if you also have an Apple Watch, the apps you use will default to the data from the Apple Watch. But if you don't, this is pretty cool. Now, the improvement with the buds is great, but that's only half the story. The other half is definitely the case. And, you know, all you can really ask for with a nice case is good battery life, charges easily, and pretty small. Check, check, and kind of check. This case is not as small as AirPods or a lot of other really small earbuds that don't have ear hooks, but this case is about 33% smaller than the last generation, and it also fits more battery inside, about three full charges worth. It also added USB Type-C now. Believe it or not, the last one was Lightning. And they also added wireless charging. You know, it's a nice case, satisfying magnetic shutting mechanism. You can track it if you lose it with Find My. I think this is a great case for a gym bag, even if it's not tiny. Speaking of battery though, the battery life just of the buds plus the case is really good. So, I basically work out every day, and using these headphones every single time I work out, I went a week without really thinking about battery life. Now, I did find it interesting that they seem to not quite drain at the exact same rate. It's not enough of a difference to raise alarm bells, but I found that curious. But here's some sick math on how this could work out. So, 10 hour battery life on the buds without ANC on. Closer to six to eight with ANC, but let's just go 10. I wouldn't wanna wear these for 10 hours straight anyway. But, every time you put them back in the case, they charge back up to 100%. And the case can fully charge the buds zero to 100 three times. So, if you do a two hour workout every single day with these buds on, you can go basically a month without thinking about battery. So that is sick. The fast charging also I think is my favorite bit. So, if you somehow forget to charge the buds and leave them out of the case and they die, okay, you can drop them in the case for literally five minutes and get over an hour of listening time just like that. So, hey, here we are in 2025, and I'm out here basically recommending Beats. I'm recommending Beats that are expensive, because they're not actually overpriced compared to what they get you versus the competition. It's crazy. You know the memes with, like, comment sections that are like, ""The downfall of X needs to be studied""? Whatever Beats is doing is basically the opposite of a downfall. You've heard me talk about Beats in the past. This should be studied too. These might be the best available earbuds for most people. I went back and looked at the last gen Powerbeats Pro, and the price has gone way down, they're around 150 bucks now, and according to my Amazon Price Tracker plugin, they've been around here for about the past month. Sounds like a good deal. But I'll remind you, these charge via Lightning and they do not have wireless charging, and this case feels ridiculous now. I actually can't recommend these anymore. You know, there's always gonna be cheaper alternatives, so I'll leave some of those down below, but the moral of the story here is these Beats are good. These Beats are really good. Well played, Dre. Thanks for watching. Subscribe for more surprisingly good tech. Catch you in the next one.

I have felt absolutely no compulsion to upgrade since, haven't needed to. It's funny, most of my work is pretty light, but occasionally I will have to edit a video on the go, which is then when, you know, the extra horsepower and the screen and everything about this comes in handy, and it's great. If I didn't have to do that ever, I would just have, like, an Air or a Surface Laptop, something like that. But that range of work is why this has been great for me, and it's been awesome so far. So along comes this M4 generation of MacBook Pros, and it's the first generation that I have actually been tempted to maybe upgrade to. You know, they've stacked a couple of the right upgrades in the right places for things that actually make a difference to me. So let's just get right into it. Nuts and bolts. 'Cause the first big pillar is performance. And the main reason why this new laptop matters at all is that it's got the new generation of M4 chips inside. And we all know the leap from Intel chips to Apple silicon chips for M1 was generational. But since then, it's been a sort of more reasonable incremental upgrade, going from M1 to M2, then M3, and then M4. So I think it's pretty obvious that nobody with an M2 or M3 needs to upgrade, but there have been enough improvements now stacking up upon each other from M1 to M4 that the numbers are now starting to get kind of interesting. So just to set the stage, this laptop that I've been using is the M1 Max maxed out. Basically, the best you could get at the time. 64 gigs of unified memory on this system. And this unit I've been testing of the M4 Max is also maxed out. It's the best you can get now; faster, stronger on the new one: Three nanometers versus five, 546 gigs per second of memory bandwidth versus 400. Just the hardware improvements to get to M4 Max are clearly there. So, to keep the apples-to-apples comparison going, Apple, in their own presentation, said up to 2.2 times faster CPU performance than M1 Max and 1.9 times faster GPU performance. So we're looking at around twice as fast, and the synthetic benchmarks I've run back this up. I got over 4,000 in Geekbench 6 CPU single core, which is the highest single core score ever in a Mac by a while. And the multi-core score was incredible, too. Tops the chart. And then, GPU has improved a lot to the point where it's bumping up against M2 Ultra. Not M2 Max, M2 Ultra chips, the one that's currently in the Mac Pro. So it's pretty clear that on paper, yeah, these M4 chips are blazing; they're incredible. But that's just on paper. What about in real life? What about real workflow stuff? So, on YouTube, you might have noticed a lot of the benchmarking and real-world stuff that you see is video editing benchmarks, just because that's the most intensive thing most YouTubers do on their computers. It's the most intensive thing I do. But yeah, that's what's gonna drive my purchase decision, so that's the first thing I looked into. So my own benchmark is literally loading up a video project in Final Cut Pro, moving things around, messing with clips, cutting, effects, tracking, and then, of course, export times. This project here is a mix of 8K RED raw footage and action camera footage with comped graphics and smaller video files from the Snapchat glasses. And not only did this laptop open and flip through Final Cut faster than any other machine I've ever used, but it also exported the final video roughly twice as fast as my M1 Max laptop, which is really exciting for me. So a pretty prime example of the performance unlocking something new is Final Cut Pro 11 just came out, and I've been messing with it for a little bit, and there's a new headlining feature called Magnetic Mask. And my theory is that it's taking pretty heavy advantage of Apple silicon, specifically the neural engine, 'cause it's ""AI-powered,"" but I had to prove it. So previously, to cut a subject out of a background in a video, it was this painstaking process called rotoscoping, where you're essentially manually drawing the mask for every single frame. Now, this one works even better than some plugins I've used, like mRotoAI, and it's even faster. Basically, all you do is click the subject and sort of refine your selection, and then once you're good to go, you just analyze forward for the entire clip and just let it do its thing, and it just continues for the whole clip. So, I ran through this on the M4 Max. I ran through this on the M1 Max, but I did some other machines as well. And the results, well, the M1 Max was able to pull this off in two minutes, 56 seconds. The M4 Max got it down to two minutes and 13 seconds. But then M2 Ultra got it down to a minute and a half. But then the Intel Xeon Mac Pro, super expensive with the dual Radeon Pro GPUs, took six minutes for the same 45-second clip here. So, the leap is crazy, and it just keeps getting better. I'm thinking M4 Ultra is gonna be, as a video editor, pretty sick. But of course, you might not be a video editor; you might be something else; you might be a photographer. I just watched Tyler Stalman's video on his M4 Max laptop. It's really good. The second half of his video, he does a lot of testing against the M1 generation with Lightroom and Resolve, and not only does it continue to crush M1 Max, but sometimes it actually gets close to or it beats the newest Mac Studio with M2 Ultra, which is pretty insane. So I'll link his whole video below; it's really good. Now, obviously, we expect Mac Studio and Mac Pro to eventually get their own M4 generation updates with the M4 Ultra chip. I'm sure that'll be immense. But even so, with this, it's crazy to see Apple silicon is still improving fast enough that this new laptop chip is outperforming some of the desktop chips from earlier years of Apple silicon. There's a bunch of other real-world benchmarks out there. I'll link some more below that are really good. But I think the bottom line from my testing and from other tests that I've watched and read is, yeah, there is now a significant bump up in performance from M1 to M4. Not just 30 or 40%, but, like, 200%, which is pretty crazy. But that by itself might not be enough to convince you to upgrade, so there's more. Luckily, several other things are updated about this laptop as well. So, first of all, this laptop is Space Black, as you may have noticed, which the M1 generation didn't have, but it's not exactly new. It's actually had the same two colors as M3, Space Black or silver. I do love me some Space Black, but anyone who has one already knows it looks really good new, but then  it kind of collects fingerprints and starts to wear over time. Still, the best solution I found is a skin over a case, just as that little bit of scratch protection, and you'll never see fingerprints again. So I'll leave a link below to channel-sponsored dbrand's Glitch skin if you wanna check that out. It's much more interesting than black or silver. But there is another visual improvement here too, and you've probably noticed it watching this video. It looks so good. That is the nano-texture display option. It is new, and I love it. It's incredible. And the thing is, I have slight reservations about how it might wear over time, but on a laptop like this, it just looks so good. Nano-texture started out as a $1,000 option on the Pro Display XDR, and this is the hardest one to recommend. Like, it's stupid expensive, and then it's also so delicate to maintain. It just picked up fingerprints so easily. You'd have to have the right low-pile soft microfiber to actually clean it. Like, it is tough. I wouldn't recommend it to most. But it seems like it improved since then because now it's a $300 option on the Studio Display that a lot of people have. Then they offered it as a $100 option on the iPad Pro, which obviously that's something people are touching constantly with their fingers, and we haven't really seen too many issues with it. And so I think on a laptop like this, like, if it can be... Geez. If it can be, like, maintenance pain-free, then it feels like a kind of no-brainer. Like, this is my favorite option on this laptop. Like, you're gonna take it all over the place in all sorts of different lighting, and just the way this matte finish just eats reflections and completely removes any lighting environment distractions from anything from an office building to a coffee shop to an airplane with a window next to you. Like, it's actually incredible. It's awesome. All laptops should have something like this. It's 100 bucks more than the glossy version for the MacBook Pro, and I'll take it every time. The fact that this is new to the M4 generation by itself, honestly, is very compelling to me. So then the only other big thing that's new here is Thunderbolt 5, which is funny; it's kind of overrated and underrated at the same time. So the outgoing laptops all have perfectly great, very fast Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports. Love that. Almost every new high-end laptop has that. These new ones here are getting Thunderbolt 5, which a lot of other machines don't have yet. And actually, the base 14-inch MacBook Pro gets one more port, too, which is great. So now they all have the three Thunderbolt 5 ports. It feels a bit underrated, maybe because it is so new and it's in so few laptops, but it is actually a genuine capability improvement. Like, we love more bandwidth, we love faster I/O. You can do three 6K displays from this laptop instead of two. So that's awesome. But there are so few Thunderbolt 5 accessories out right now, and the ones that do start to come out you also notice are pretty expensive. So my favorite accessory in the world right now, for example, I think, is the Samsung X5, the Thunderbolt 3 drive. It's incredible. 2,800 megabyte per second read speeds. They don't sell them anymore, but you can get a nearly equivalent two-terabyte SanDisk drive for about 275 bucks, right? Then there's the new OWC Thunderbolt 5 drive, and it'll read and write at 6,000 megabytes per second. Damn! But it's also two terabytes for 400 bucks. So, you know, as a video editor who's passing around really large files, like, I'm gonna want one of these at some point. I'm gonna wait for more options; it's gonna be great. But I think the point of Thunderbolt 5 on these computers is that ecosystem of Thunderbolt 5 accessories, drives, docks, interfaces, that's gonna be built up over time. This is great for future-proofing the thing, but it doesn't actually affect most people right away. Unless you're literally gonna plug in three Pro Displays right off the bat. So then there's a couple of other little, smaller things. You know, the new Center Stage ultra-wide webcam that will follow you around. I actually think it looks better, which is nice. The battery life is also rated to be slightly better, thanks to the M4's improved efficiency. So I think this is mostly gonna come into effect under lighter workloads, but you'd love to see it. Same size battery, better battery life. And then, the screen has a higher SDR max brightness of 1,000 nits over the previous; I think it was 500 or 600. So, if you're in a brighter space, whether you have nano-texture or not, everything is more readable. And it turns out Apple quietly updated all these MacBook Pros to quantum dot displays and didn't tell anybody. They're probably still on their way to OLED. But yeah, these improvements to quantum dot and efficiency and especially responsiveness, it might just be confirmation bias, but I feel like the responsiveness is actually noticeable to my eye. So you might not upgrade just for the performance improvements, but they are pretty good. You might not upgrade just for the new nano-texture finish, but it is really good. And you definitely won't upgrade just for Thunderbolt 5 or just for the slightly brighter display or the ultra-wide webcam. But I think all of these things stacked on top of each other combined is... I think you actually can justify an upgrade this year. If you are regularly pushing this laptop to its limits, you can justify this improvement, or at least that's what I'm telling myself. M1 Max is gonna be perfectly fine for another year though, no question about that. I also think it's really interesting that we basically have Apple Intelligence to thank for all of these new Macs basically having a new minimum of 16 gigs of unified memory. It just makes all of the base Macs feel like a better deal now. And the Mac Mini is amazing, and there's more to come. We know there's gonna be more M4 chips on the horizon. But it was a really good new laptop. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one.

the thing is, I have slight reservations"", ""start"": 439}, {""text"": ""about how it might wear over time,"", ""start"": 442}, {""text"": ""but on a laptop like this, it just looks so good."",
